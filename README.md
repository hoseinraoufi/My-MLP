Implementation of MLP Neural Network : 

In this project, a MLP artificial neural network algorithm and Backpropagation using the VS Code environment was implemented in Python, without utilizing any AI or data analysis libraries. 
The implementation allowed for the creation of a customizable number of layers, neurons, and activation functions. 
A key aspect of this project was that the condition for stopping the weight and bias updates, unlike conventional methods, was achieving a desired accuracy in the output neurons of the output layer.
you can use hiddenlayer.csv file to create yor desired number of hidden layers, neurons and activation functions
